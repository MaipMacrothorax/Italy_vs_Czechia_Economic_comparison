Economic Comparison: Italy vs Czechia (2023–2024)

This project provides a comparative economic assessment of Italy and Czechia, focusing on structural differences in unemployment, poverty, and wage distribution.
All data come from Eurostat (2023–2024), and the full analysis (tables + charts) is available in the /analysis/ folder.
In the folder /presentation/ there is a PowerPoint presentation with my audio explaining the key findings.

_Unemployment Rate Decomposition (2023)
The unemployment gap between Italy and Czechia is decomposed into:
	•	Rate effect → differences in unemployment within each age group
	•	Structure effect → differences in population composition
KEY FINDING:
Italy’s unemployment rate is significantly higher, mainly driven by youth unemployment (15–24).
The rate effect dominates, meaning the gap originates from labour-market performance, not demographic structure.
Interpretation:
Italy faces structural barriers in the school-to-work transition and weaker labour demand.

_At-risk-of-Poverty Rate Decomposition (2024)
This section decomposes differences in poverty risk into:
	•	Intensity effect → differences in outcomes within age groups
	•	Structure effect → differences in demographic composition
KEY FINDING:
Italy’s higher poverty risk is explained mostly by worse outcomes within each demographic group, not by population structure.
Czechia performs better due to more effective redistribution and more equal income distribution.

_Median Net Income by Education Level (2024)
Net median yearly income is compared for ISCED education levels:
	•	0–2 (Low education)
	•	3–4 (Medium education)
	•	5–8 (High education)
KEY FINDING:
Czech wages amount to about 73% of Italian median wages.
The income gap widens with education, indicating:
	•	Stronger returns to education in Italy
	•	Higher wage dispersion
	•	More inequality at the top end of the skill distribution

  Final Perspective

Italy combines higher wages with greater inequality and weaker labour-market integration, while Czechia shows lower wages but more balanced outcomes and stronger social inclusion.
